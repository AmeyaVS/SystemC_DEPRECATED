1) Installation Notes for Unix
==============================

All you have to do is unpack the systemc_regressions-2.3.2.tgz file in the
directory of your choice, .e.g,

  > gtar zxvf systemc_regressions-2.3.2.tgz

This will create the directory systemc_regressions-2.3.2 containing the test
source code and scripts.

Refer to the README file on how to run the regression tests.


2) Installation Notes for Windows
=================================

Unpack the regression tests using a suitable compression programme, e.g., 7zip.

Refer to the README file on how to run the regression tests, but also to
README_windows.txt for more details.

Note: To run the regression tests on Windows, a basic Un*x shell environment like
  - Cygwin 1.3.x, or later       (http://cygwin.org)
  - MinGW/MSYS 1.0.14, or later  (http://mingw.org)
is required.
