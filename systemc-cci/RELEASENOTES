1) Overview
===========

This release of the Configuration, Control and Inspection (CCI) "Proof of 
Concept" implementation is being made available for public review and feedback.
It works optimally with SystemC 2.3.2 utilizing its hierarchical name registry
to detect and mitigate parameter name collisions. It doesn't address name 
collisions but otherwise works fine on prior versions of SystemC.


2) Known Issues
===============

  - Some paths in this release are longer than the historical 99 character
    limit of tar archives, and several Windows archivers (e.g. WinZip)
    have been reported to trip over this.  The open source archiver 7-zip
    (http://7-zip.org) is known to work.

  - The POC incorporates a JSON library (rapidson) which must be obtained
    separately at this time (see README.txt for details). In the future this
	should be redistributed as an embedded component of the POC implementation
	in order to simplify installation.

  - Handle assignments, both broker and parameter, currently transfer originator
	information. The destination handle should instead keep/determine its 
	originator appropriately. This will be fixed in the next release.

  - Originator construction currently accepts a string argument even within the
	module hierarchy context even though it has no real effect. Semantics will
	likely be sharpened in the future such that a name is accepted only when
	constructing an originator outside of the module hierarchy.

  - It has not been decided whether it should be allowable to register a broker
	for a module after some of its parameters have been constructed. Allowing
	this facilitates allocating some parameters to the parent broker and others
	to a local broker but it seems to carry a conceptual complexity price tag.

  - Parameter names may be registered in the future when a preset value is 
	provided to the broker. This would allow earlier detection of name collisions.

  - There is no Example #19 so the numbering is non-consecutive. A new example
	will fill this slot before the next release.
